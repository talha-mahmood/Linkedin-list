# Icons Required

Place the following PNG icon files in this directory:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

These icons are referenced in `manifest.json` and are essential for the extension to load correctly and be clickable in the browser toolbar.

**Design Tips:**
- Use a transparent background.
- Keep the design simple and clear, recognizable at 16x16.
- Consider using the LinkedIn blue (`#0077B5`) or a related color.
- A symbol representing categorization or organization is recommended.
